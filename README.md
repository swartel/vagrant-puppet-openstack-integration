1. [Overview - What is Vagrant Puppet OpenStack Integration for?](#Overview)


Overview
--------

This aim of this project is to deploy your OpenStack ready for integration using
vagrant as a nice way to set up a scalable puppet environment.
All OpenStack puppet modules used here come from the official gerrit OpenStack
repository in view to stay as closed as possible to the OpenStack best effort
improvements.

Work in progress so coming soon...
